# BCMS Kids' Favorites Cookbook 🍳👧

*A fundraiser cookbook for Big City Montessori School*

## The Concept

Every family submits their kid's favorite recipe, a photo of their child, and a fun story about why they love it. We compile it into a beautiful cookbook that families can purchase — proceeds go to the school.

## What Parents Submit

1. **Recipe** — kid's favorite, easy enough for kids to help make
   - Ingredients list
   - Step-by-step instructions
2. **Photo** — of their child (cooking, eating, or just being cute)
3. **The story** — why it's their favorite, a funny memory, a silly fact

## What We Need to Build

- [ ] Submission form (Google Form? Custom site?)
- [ ] Photo upload system
- [ ] Recipe template (consistent formatting)
- [ ] Review/editing workflow
- [ ] Print production (Blurb, Mixbook, or similar)
- [ ] Order system for families

## Open Questions

- [ ] School name / logo to include?
- [ ] Deadline for submissions?
- [ ] Target price point?
- [ ] How many families in the school? (estimate submissions)
- [ ] Print-on-demand vs bulk order?

## Timeline

TBD

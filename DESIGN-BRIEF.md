# BCMS Community Cookbook — Design Brief

## Project Overview
A digital community cookbook for Bernal Cove Montessori School's fundraiser. Families contribute their favorite recipes, creating a keepsake that celebrates the school community while raising funds.

## Goals
1. **Fundraiser Success** — Drive donations and cookbook purchases
2. **Community Celebration** — Showcase the diverse families and their food traditions  
3. **Usability** — Busy parents cooking from their phones, often with kids underfoot
4. **Keepsake Quality** — Something families will treasure, not just use once

## Audience
- **Primary**: BCMS parents (busy, professional, cooking at home)
- **Secondary**: Grandparents, extended family who want to support
- **Context**: Phone propped on counter, flour on hands, toddler asking questions

## Constraints
- Mobile-first (80%+ will use phones while cooking)
- Fast loading (no patience when dinner's on the line)
- Accessible (good contrast, readable type, thumb-friendly targets)
- Works offline-ish (recipes should be easy to screenshot/save)

## Design Direction
**"Warm Editorial Keepsake"** — Not a sterile recipe database. This should feel like a beautiful cookbook you'd display on your shelf, but one that works beautifully on mobile.

## Reference Analysis

### 1. Fäviken (Phaidon Press)
**What works**: Vintage-inspired simplicity, putty-colored borders creating warmth, traditional but unfailingly stylish layouts. Photography framed intentionally, not just dropped in.
**Steal this**: The restrained color palette that feels warm without being saccharine. The sense that every element has been considered.

### 2. Vefa's Kitchen (Phaidon Press)
**What works**: Old-fashioned feel with contemporary execution. Rustic photography with a homely vibe. Art-inspired cover energy.
**Steal this**: The warmth and authenticity. Recipes feel like they come from someone's home, not a test kitchen.

### 3. Mexico: The Cookbook (Phaidon Press)
**What works**: Breaks the "rustic-is-best" rule with vibrant, modern energy. Collage-inspired typography. Silhouetted graphics add playfulness.
**Steal this**: The confidence to be bold. Community cookbooks can be joyful and energetic, not just nostalgic.

## Typography Direction
- **Display**: Something with warmth and character — hand-drawn qualities or soft serifs
- **Body**: Highly readable, generous line-height, works at smaller sizes
- **Accent**: Playful element for family names, section headers

## Color Palette
- **Foundation**: Warm cream/ivory (not stark white)
- **Accent**: Terracotta/rust (warmth, food-adjacent, inviting)
- **Text**: Warm charcoal (softer than black)
- **Highlight**: Sage green (fresh, Montessori-ish, natural)

## Key Screens
1. **Hero/Landing** — The 50% of the work. Emotional, inviting, clear CTA
2. **Recipe Index** — Browse by family, cuisine, meal type
3. **Recipe Detail** — Clean, scannable, thumb-scrollable
4. **Contribute** — Submit your family's recipe (form)
5. **About/Support** — The fundraiser story, donate CTA
